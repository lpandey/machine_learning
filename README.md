# machine_learning
This repository is a result of me trying to implement some of the basic machine learning algorithms 
and concepts I came across from
1) having taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
2) having read Aur√©lien Geron's Hands-On Machine Learning book (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
with an aim to further my understanding. I welcome suggestions and feedback.
